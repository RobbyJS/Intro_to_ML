    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\\\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\\\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\\\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "* Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "* Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalisation, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Note however that this module does not support missing values.\n",

    "* Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "* Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",

    "The Random Forest model is the model chosen for the task. \n",
    "As can be seen on the bottom graphs, all three models obtain very similiar f-scores and accuracy scores on the test data. For the training data,  the Random Forest model performs the best for the different number of samples explored. The scores calculated from the training data or from the testing data do not converge for the Random Forest as the number of samples increases. This fact can indicate that the model is overfitting with the default parameters. However, despite possibly overfitting, Random Forests obtain a score with the test data that is roughly the same than for the other two models. The fact that the model is overfitting and still obtains similar scores with the test data than the other models, could indicate that there is marge for improvement in the scores and thus it is the model chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Random Forest seems suitable for the data as it can handle both numerical and cathegorical features. Computation time is slightly worse than the Logistic Regression model but much better than Support Vector Machines classifier, which makes it a good choice also from that point of view. Both the training time and the prediction time are below 10 seconds."

    "\n",
    "Random Forests is an ensemble method which recurs to a certain number of \"basic\" models for its construction. The basic model used by a Random Forest is a Decision Tree. Thus, to explain how Random Forests work Decision Trees need to be explained as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction of a Random Forest is obtained by a majority vote from each of the Decision Trees that compose the model. A Decision Tree makes its prediction by making the data go thorugh a set of nodes defined in the training phase. Each of the nodes focuses in a feature of the data, and depending on the feature value the point will go in one of two directions. Then it arrives to another node where another split is performed in the same way, until the point arrives to a \"leaf\" (final) node, where no split is performed and the data is assigned to a cathegory. The cathegory of the data is obtained from the training of the Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a Decision Tree, all the nodes that perform a split need to be calculated. Thus, starting at the top node (or root node), the algorithm tests different features and different boundaries for each feature, so that the data in the child nodes is more organised (or contains more information). This means roughly that the child nodes have more prevalence of one cathegory or the other than the parent node. The process keeps going for both child nodes until at some point, splitting a node further does not provide more information. This can happen if for example all data points at one node belong to a cathegory, or if the proportion of the two labels is going to be the same after splitting. That node is a final or leaf node and it provides the cathegory of the majority of points. To train a Random Forest model, a set of Decision Trees have to be trained individually. The training algorithm is the same for each of the Decision Trees, but each Decision Tree will have access to only a part of the data, and only some of data features will be used. "

However, the relation between capital loss and income is more complex: more capital loss results in lower income , but at the same time a person that can afford more capital loss it is because his income (without considering investments) is larger. For this reason it is considered as the second most important feature to predict the label. \n",

    "**Answer:**<br>\n",
    "The five features provided by the visualization are: \n",
    "- capital gain, which was provided and in the same position\n",
    "- marital-stauts_Married-civ-spouse, which was not. This feature comes from creating a dummy variable from marital-status.\n",
    "- education-num, which was provided although with fewer importance,\n",
    "- relationship_Husband, it was not provided neither. It is a dummy variable created from the relationship cathegory,\n",
    "- age: it was provided but the importance hypothesized was larger. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "As to the **marital-status_Married-civ-spouse** and **relationship_Husband** (which should be in principle highly related between them), it is hard to say why they are important for identifying individuals with large incomes. According to the database description, the income is considered individually and not by a household, so the fact that several people bring income to a household should not have an impact in the individual incomes. An hypothesis to explain the importance of these features could be that having more than one salary in a household results in a better financial health and the possibility to invest more, which in turn could result in larger average individual incomes.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The relative importance of **education-num** and **age** was not correctly predicted either. It could be that although with the age the salaries will increase, for certain jobs that require no degree, increasing the age will not make that individual go above the 50K$ threshold. Those cases could reduce the predictive capacity of age, making higher education play a more important role at the end."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "I would definitely consider using the reduced data as the training set if training time was a factor, as the model obtained from the reduced data set does not suffer from a huge degradation in the scores (below a 5% degradation) but the features have been reduced from 103 features to 5 features, which can have a huge impact in computational times. Additionally, the hyperparameters of the model that uses reduced data have not been optimized, whereas the hyperparameters of the model using the full data were optimized. So the scores provided by the model with the reduced data could be improved by optimizing the hyperparameters, making the reduction in the scores smaller."
